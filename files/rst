The existing code script you've provided seems designed to extract and print out code blocks from markdown files, specified with the language marker (e.g., "python"). To modify this to provide a high-level explanation of a module for a `.rst` (reStructuredText) file, we would need to adjust the script to meet the conventions of `.rst` syntax.

Here's a concise and constructive response with feedback on the script, in line with your request:

The script is well-structured and the logic for extracting code blocks is clearly implemented, which will serve as a solid foundation when adapting the concept to `.rst` files. For extension to `.rst` file processing, consider these enhancements:

1. The regular expression pattern should be updated to match the syntax used for denoting code blocks within `.rst` files, often delineated by `.. code-block:: language` instead of triple backticks.

2. The `extract_code_blocks` function should be refactored to support different file types and handle `.rst` specific patterns.

3. The script currently exits upon encountering an error, which is a good practice for critical issues. However, for non-critical issues, you might want to handle errors more gracefully by possibly logging them or providing alternative solutions without terminating the script.

4. Since `.rst` files may contain other directives and specific formatting, any function designed to extract content should be sensitive to these elements and ensure that only the intended content is captured and processed.

5. Your script could benefit from a user-friendly command-line interface, perhaps utilizing a library like `argparse`, to handle various arguments (like the file format) in a more robust and flexible manner.

6. Documenting your functions and script with proper docstrings and comments will make it easier for future contributors to understand and maintain the code.

Overall, these initial recommendations will help you adapt the script for `.rst` files while maintaining readability and functionality. Remember to test your changes thoroughly to ensure compatibility with `.rst` syntax and to catch any edge cases.
