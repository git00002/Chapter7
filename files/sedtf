# This is your script.sh

# Suppose you have a command whose output you want to process
# For example, let's say you have a command that lists files in a directory
ls -l /path/to/directory

# Now, you can use the | operator to pass the output to another command
# Let's use 'awk' to extract specific columns from the output
ls -l /path/to/directory | awk '{print $1, $5}'

# Alternatively, you can use 'sed' to perform text transformations
ls -l /path/to/directory | sed 's/old_pattern/new_pattern/'

# You can also use 'grep' to filter lines based on a pattern
ls -l /path/to/directory | grep "pattern_to_search"

# If you want to use 'cut' to extract columns, you can do this
ls -l /path/to/directory | cut -d' ' -f1,5
