I apologize for the confusion earlier. It appears there are remnants of unrelated text present in your message that complicated the task interpretation. 

Your aim seems to be to process text encapsulated in blocks delimited by triple backquotes (```). For each extracted block, you wish to present the option to write the block to a file, and you expect user input to proceed to subsequent blocks. 

To improve the implementation and to maintain clarity, let's focus on the following steps:

1. **Iterate Over Blocks**: Retrieve each block from the provided input source, which can be a string or read from a file.

2. **Display Block**: Show each retrieved block to the user.

3. **User Choice**: After displaying each block, prompt the user with a choice to either write the block to a file, skip to the next one, or exit the process.

4. **Write to File**: If the user chooses to write the block to the file, do so without overwriting any previous content.

5. **Error Handling**: Throughout this process, make sure to account for potential exceptions, such as issues with file I/O operations, to ensure robustness.

Here is a conceptual pseudo-code that demonstrates these steps:

```python
blocks = extract_blocks(input_source)  # Function to extract blocks from source

for block in blocks:
    print(block)  # Display the current block
    user_input = input("Write to file (w), skip (s), or exit (e)? ")
    
    if user_input.lower() == 'w':
        try:
            with open('output.txt', 'a') as file:  # 'a' ensures appending to the file
                file.write(block + "\n\n")  # Write the block and add spacing
            print("Block written to file.")
        except IOError as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    
    elif user_input.lower() == 'e':
        print("Exiting.")
        break  # Terminate the iteration
    
    # 's' to skip is implicit as it will continue to the next loop iteration
```

This is a simplified structure and doesn't include the actual code to extract the blocks, you will need to implement the `extract_blocks` method. Also, ensure the user inputs are being handled safely and the script functions as intended in case of unexpected input.

Lastly, it's important that your code comments and messages are clear to maintainers or other developers who might work with your code. Make sure to remove any "placeholder" or "template" text that doesn't have to do directly with your application. Clear and meaningful variable names also go a long way in ensuring code readability and maintainability.
